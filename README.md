I recently purchased Jonas' JavaScript course, and as part of the learning process, I built a "Guess the Number" game using vanilla JS. I primarily used nested if-else statements and functions to implement the game logic. The project consists of three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js, making it a basic yet effective way to practice my JavaScript skills!
